# My Groups - User Guide

## Understanding Saved Groups vs Session Groups

### 🏠 Saved Group (Your Template)
- **What it is**: A reusable template for your regular dining crew
- **Saved info**: Group name, location preferences, member names
- **Stored**: Permanently in your account
- **Example**: "Friday Night Crew" with Bob, Alice, and Charlie

### 🎟️ Session Group (One-Time Code)
- **What it is**: A specific dining session with a shareable code
- **Created each time**: When you click "Start Session"
- **Group code**: Like "CHKN22" - share this with friends
- **Expires**: After 24 hours or when finished
- **Example**: Tonight's dinner at 7pm - everyone joins with code CHKN22

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ Create a Saved Group (One Time)
```
Account → My Groups → Create New Group
- Name: "Friday Night Crew"
- ZIP Code: 10001
- Radius: 10 miles
- Price: $$
- Members: Bob, Alice, Charlie
→ Click "Create Group"
```

### 2️⃣ Start a Session (Every Time You Eat)
```
My Groups → Select "Friday Night Crew" → Start Session
- Your name: John
- Create Group button generates: CHKN22
→ Share code "CHKN22" with Bob, Alice, Charlie
```

### 3️⃣ Friends Join
```
Each friend:
- Opens ChickenTinders
- Enters their name
- Enters code: CHKN22
- Joins the session
```

### 4️⃣ Everyone Swipes
```
All members swipe on restaurants
When everyone finishes → See matches!
```

## Key Points

✅ **Saved Groups** = Your recurring crew (saved forever)
✅ **Sessions** = Tonight's dinner (one-time code)
✅ **You create sessions FROM saved groups** (pre-fills your preferences)
✅ **Each session gets a new code** to share

## Why Two Types?

**Without Saved Groups:**
- Enter ZIP code every time ❌
- Remember everyone's names ❌
- Set preferences again ❌
- Time consuming! ❌

**With Saved Groups:**
- One-click session start ✅
- Pre-filled preferences ✅
- Member list ready ✅
- Share code instantly ✅

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to create a new saved group every time?**
A: No! Create it once, use it forever. Just click "Start Session" each time.

**Q: Why do I need to enter my name when starting a session?**
A: The session is live for tonight. You're creating the group and inviting others to join with the code.

**Q: Can my friends see my saved groups?**
A: No, saved groups are private. Friends join by entering the session code you share.

**Q: What if I have different friend groups?**
A: Create multiple saved groups! "Friday Crew", "Work Lunch", "Family Dinners", etc.

**Q: Do saved group members auto-join sessions?**
A: No - you still need to share the session code. Members use their own devices to join and swipe.

**Q: Can I edit a saved group?**
A: Yes! Click "Edit" on any saved group to update preferences or members.
