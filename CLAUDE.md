## Key Principles

1. **Avoid generic AI aesthetics** - No Inter, Roboto, Arial, or purple gradients on white
2. **Commit to a bold direction** - Intentionality matters more than intensity
3. **Luxury = restraint** - Every element must justify its presence
4. **Performance matters** - LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1
5. **Accessibility is non-negotiable** - 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard nav, semantic HTML
